# Chapter 24. Building SSA in a Compiler for PHP
**Paul Biggar and David Gregg**

Dynamic scripting languages such as PHP, Python, and JavaScript are among the most widely used programming languages.

Dynamic scripting languages provide flexible high-level features, a fast modify-compile-test environment for rapid prototyping, strong integration with popular strongly typed programming languages, and an extensive standard library. Dynamic scripting languages are widely used in the implementation of many of the best-known web applications of the last decade such as Facebook, Wikipedia, and Gmail. Most web browsers support scripting languages such as JavaScript for client-side applications that run within the browser. Languages such as PHP and Ruby are popular for server-side web pages that generate content dynamically and provide close integration with back-end databases.

One of the most widely used dynamic scripting languages is PHP, a general-purpose language that was originally designed for creating dynamic web pages. PHP has many of the features that are typical of dynamic scripting languages. These include a simple syntax, dynamic typing and the ability to dynamically generate new source code during runtime, and execute that code. These simple flexible features facilitate rapid prototyping, exploratory programming, and in the case of many non-professional websites, a copy-paste-and-modify approach to scripting by non-expert programmers.

Constructing SSA form for languages such as C/C++ and Java is a well-studied problem. Techniques exist to handle the most common features of static languages, and these solutions have been tried and tested in production-level compilers over many years. In these static languages, it is not difficult to identify a set of scalarvariables that can be safely renamed. Better analysis may lead to more such variables being identified, but significant numbers of such variables can be found with very simple analysis.

In our study of optimizing dynamic scripting languages, specifically PHP, we find this is not the case. The information required to build SSA form--that is, a conservatively complete set of unaliased scalars, and the locations of their uses and definitions--is not available directly from the program source and cannot be derived from a simple analysis. Instead, we find a litany of features whose presence must be ruled out, or heavily analysed, in order to obtain a non-pessimistic estimate.

Dynamic scripting languages commonly feature runtime generation of source code, which is then executed, built-in functions, and variable-variables, all of which may alter arbitrary unnamed variables. Less common--but still possible--features include the existence of object handlers which have the ability to alter any part of the program state, most dangerously a function's local symbol table. The original implementations of dynamic scripting languages were all interpreted, and in many cases, this led to their creators including very dynamic language features that are easy to implement in an interpreter but make program analysis and compilation very difficult.

Ruling out the presence of these features requires precise, inter-procedural, whole-program analysis. We discuss the futility of the pessimistic solution, the analyses required to provide a precise SSA form, and how the presence of variables of unknown types affects the precision of SSA.

Note that dynamic scripting languages share similar features of other kinds of dynamic programming languages, such as Lisp and Smalltalk. The main distinguishing feature of dynamic languages is that they resolve at runtime behaviours that many other languages perform at compile time. Thus, languages such as Lisp support dynamic typing and runtime generation of source code which can then be executed. The main difference between scripting languages and other dynamic languages is their intended use, rather than the features of the language. Scripting languages were originally designed for writing short scripts, often to invoke other programs or services. It was only later that developers started to write large complex programs using scripting languages.

The rest of this chapter describes our experiences with building SSA in PHC, an open source compiler for PHP. We identify the features of PHP that make building SSA difficult, outline the solutions we found to these some of these challenges, and draw some lessons about the use of SSA in analysis frameworks for PHP.

## 24.1 SSA Form in Statically Typed Languages

In statically typed, non-scripting languages, such as C, C++, and Java, it is straightforward to identify which variables may be converted into SSA form. In Java, all scalars may be renamed. In C and C++, any scalar variables that do not have their address taken may be renamed. Figure 24.1 shows a simple C function,whose local variables may all be converted into SSA form. In Fig. 24.1, it is trivial to convert each variable into SSA form. For each statement, the list of variables that are used and defined is immediately obvious from a simple syntactic check.

By contrast, Fig. 24.2 contains variables that cannot be trivially converted into SSA form. On Line 3, the variable $x$ has its address taken. As a result, to convert $x$ into SSA form, we must know that Line 4 modifies $x$ and introduce a new version of $x$ accordingly. Chapter 16 describes HSSA form, a powerful way to represent _indirect_ modifications to scalars in SSA form.

To discover the modification of $x$ on Line 4 requires an _alias analysis_. Alias analyses detect when multiple program names (_aliases_) represent the same memory location. In Fig. 24.2, $x$ and $*y$ alias each other.

There are many variants of alias analysis, of varying complexity. The most complex ones analyse the entire program text, taking into account the control flow, the function calls, and multiple levels of pointers. However, it is not difficult to perform a very simple alias analysis. _Address-taken alias analysis_ identifies all variables whose addresses are taken by a referencing assignment. All variables whose address has been taken anywhere in the program are considered to alias each other (that is, all address-taken variables are in the same _alias set_).

When building SSA form with address-taken alias analysis, variables in the alias set are not renamed into SSA form. All other variables are converted. Variables not in SSA form do not possess any SSA properties, and pessimistic assumptions must be made. As a result of address-taken alias analysis, it is straightforward to convert any C program into SSA form, without sophisticated analysis. In fact, this allows more complex alias analyses to be performed on the SSA form.

## 24.2 PHP and Aliasing

In PHP, it is not possible to perform an address-taken alias analysis. The syntactic clues that C provides--notably as a result of static typing--are not available in PHP. Indeed, statements that may appear innocuous may perform complex operations behind the scenes, affecting any variable in the function. Figure 24.3 shows a small piece of PHP code. Note that in PHP, variable names start with the $ sign.

The most common appearance of aliasing in PHP is due to variables that store references. Creating references in PHP does not look so very different from C. In Fig. 24.3, the variable $y$ becomes a reference to the variable $x$. Once $y$ has become an alias for $x$, the assignment to $y$ (in Line 3) also changes the value of $x$.

On first glance, the PHP code in Fig. 24.3 is not very different from similar C code in Fig. 24.2. From the syntax, it is easy to see that a reference to the variable $x$ is taken. Thus, it is clear that $x$ cannot be easily renamed. However, the problem is actually with the variable $y$ which contains the reference to the variable $x$.

There is no type declaration to say that $y$ in Fig. 24.3 is a reference. In fact, due to dynamic typing, PHP variables may be references at one point in the program and stop being references a moment later. Or at a given point in a program, a given variable may be a reference variable or a non-reference variable depending upon the control flow that preceded that point. PHP's dynamic typing makes it difficult to simply identify when this occurs, and a sophisticated analysis over a larger region of code is essential to building a more precise conservative SSA form.

The size of this larger region of code is heavily influenced by the semantics of function parameters in PHP. Consider the PHP function in Fig. 24.4a. Superficially, it resembles the C function in Fig. 24.4b. In the C version, we know that $x$ and $y$ are simple integer variables and that no pointer aliasing relationship between them is possible. They are separate variables that can be safely renamed. In fact, a relatively simple analysis can show that the assignment to $x$ in Line 2 of the C code can be optimized away because it is an assignment to a dead variable.

In the PHP version in Fig. 24.4a, $x$ may alias $y$ upon function entry. This can happen if $x$ is a reference to $y$, or vice versa, or if both $x$ and $y$ are references to a. It is important to note, however, that the possibility of such aliasing is not apparent from the function prototype or any type declarations. Instead, whether the formal parameter $x$ and/or $y$ are references depends on the types of actual parameters that are passed when the function is invoked. If a reference is passed as a parameter to a function in PHP, the corresponding formal parameter in the function also becomes a reference.
![image.png](https://blog-1314253005.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/202310110308829.png)

The addition operation in Line 2 of Fig. 24.4a may therefore change the value of $y$, if $x$ is a reference to $y$ or vice versa. In addition, recall that dynamic typing in PHP means that whether or not a variable contains a reference can depend on control flow leading to different assignments. Therefore, on some executions of a function, the passed parameters may be references, whereas on other executions they may not.

In the PHP version, there are no syntactic clues that variables may alias. Furthermore, as we show in Sect. 24.4, there are additional features of PHP that can cause the values of variables to be changed without simple syntactic clues. In order to be sure that no such features can affect a given variable, an analysis is needed to detect such features. As a result, a simple conservative aliasing estimate that does not take account of PHP's references and other difficult features--similar to C's address-taken alias analysis--would need to place all variables in the alias set. This would leave no variables available for conversion to SSA form. Instead, an inter-procedural analysis is needed to track references between functions.

## 24.3 Our Whole-Program Analysis

PHP's dynamic typing means that program analysis cannot be performed a function at a time. As function signatures do not indicate whether parameters are references, this information must be determined by inter-procedural analysis. Furthermore, each function must be analysed with full knowledge of its calling context. This requires a whole-program analysis. We present an overview of the analysis below. A full description is beyond the scope of this chapter.

### 24.3.1 The Analysis Algorithm

The analysis is structured as a symbolic execution. This means the program is analysed by processing each statement in turn and modelling the effect of the statement on the program state. This is similar in principle to the sparse conditional constant propagation (SSA-CCP) algorithm described in Sect. 8.3.[^1]

[^1]: The analysis is actually based on a variation, conditional constant propagation.

The SCCP algorithm models a function at a time. Instead, our algorithm models the entire program. The execution state of the program begins empty, and the analysis begins at the first statement in the program, which is placed in a worklist. The worklist is then processed a statement at a time.

For each analysed statement, the results of the analysis are stored. If the analysis results change, the statement's direct successors (in the control-flow graph) are added to the worklist. This is similar to to the treatment of CFG edges (through _CFGWorkList_) in the SCCP algorithm. There is no parallel to the treatment of SSA edges (_SSAWorkList_), since the analysis is not performed on the SSA form. Instead, loops must be fully analysed if their headers change.

This analysis is therefore less efficient than the SCCP algorithm, in terms of time. It is also less efficient in terms of space. SSA form allows results to be compactly stored in a single array, using the SSA index as an array index. This is very space efficient. In our analysis, we must instead store a table of variable results at all points in the program.

Upon reaching a function or method call, the analysis begins analysing the callee function, pausing the caller's analysis. A new worklist is created and initialized with the first statement in the callee function. The worklist is then run until it is exhausted. If another function call is analysed, the process recurses.

Upon reaching a callee function, the analysis results are copied into the scope of the callee. Once a worklist has ended, the analysis results for the exit node of the function are copied back to the calling statement's results.

### 24.3.2 Analysis Results

Our analysis computes and stores three different kinds of results. Each kind of result is stored at each point in the program.

The first models the alias relationships in the program in a _points-to graph_. The graph contains variable names as nodes, and the edges between them indicate aliasing relationships. An aliasing relationship indicates that two variables either _must_-alias or _may_-alias. Two unconnected nodes cannot alias. A points-to graph is stored for each point in the program. Graphs are merged at CFG join nodes.

Secondly, our analysis also computes a conservative estimate of the types of variables in the program. Since PHP is an object-oriented language, polymorphic method calls are possible, and they must be analysed. As such, the set of possible types of each variable is stored at each point in the program. This portion of the analysis closely resembles using SCCP for type propagation.

Finally, like the SCCP algorithm, constants are identified and propagated through the analysis of the program. Where possible, the algorithm resolves branches statically using propagated constant values. This is particularly valuable because our PHC ahead-of-time compiler for PHP creates many branches in the intermediate representation during early stages of compilation. Resolving these branches statically eliminates unreachable paths, leading to significantly more precise results from the analysis algorithm.

### 24.3.3 Building Def-Use Sets

To build SSA form, we need to be able to identify the set of points in a program where a given variable is defined or used. Since we cannot easily identify these sets due to potential aliasing, we build them as part of our program analysis. Using our alias analysis, any variables that may be written to or read from during a statement's execution are added to a set of defs and uses for that statement. These are then used during construction of the SSA form.

For an assignment by copy, $\$x=\$y$:

1. $\$x$'s value is defined.
2. $\$x$'s reference is used (by the assignment to $\$x$).
3. For each alias $\$x\_alias$ of $\$x$, $\$x\_alias$'s value is defined. If the alias is possible, $\$x\_alias$'s value is may-defined instead of defined. In addition, $\$x\_alias$'s reference is used.
4. $\$y$'s value is used.
5. $\$y$'s reference is used.

For an assignment by reference, $\$x=\&\$y$:

1. $\$x$'s value is defined.
2. $\$x$'s reference is defined (it is not used--$\$x$ does not maintain its previous reference relationships).
3. $\$y$'s value is used.
4. $\$y$'s reference is used.

### 24.3.4 HSSA

Once the set of locations where each variable is defined or used has been identified, we have the information needed to construct SSA. However, it is important to note that due to potential aliasing and potential side effects of some difficult-to-analyse PHP features (see Sect. 24.4), many of the definitions we compute are may-definitions. Whereas a normal definition of a variable means that the variable will definitely be defined, a may-definition means that the variable may be defined at that point.2

Footnote 2: Or more precisely, a may-definition means that there exists at least one possible execution of the program where the variable is defined at that point. Our algorithm computes a conservative approximation of may-definition information. Therefore, our algorithm reports a may-definition in any case where the algorithm cannot prove that no such definition can exist on any possible execution.

In order to accommodate these may-definitions in our SSA form for PHP, we adapt a number of features from Hashed SSA form.

After performing our alias analysis, we convert our intermediate representation into SSA form. As in HSSA form, we give names to all memory locations in our program, including locations inside arrays and hash tables, if they are directly referred to in source being analysed.

We augment our SSA form with $\mu$ and $\chi$ functions, representing may-uses and may-definitions, respectively.

Principally, the difference between our SSA form and traditional SSA is that all names in the program are included in the SSA representation. In addition, for each statement in the program, we maintain a set of names which must be defined, which might be defined, and which are used (either possibly or definitely). Names that may be defined are the same concept as $\chi$ variables in HSSA, but there may also be more than one name that _must_ be defined.

We also add $\phi$-functions for names that are only used in $\chi$ operations or which must be defined but are not syntactically present in the statement. As these $\phi$-functions are not for real variables, we cannot add copies to represent them when destructing SSA form and must instead drop all SSA indices. While this is a valid means of destructing SSA form, it slightly limits the optimizations that can be performed. For example, copy-propagation cannot move copies past the boundary of a variable's live range.

We do not use virtual variables, zero versioning, or global value numbering (the _hash_ in _Hashed SSA_). However, in order to scale our SSA form in the future, it would be necessary to incorporate these features.

The final distinction from traditional SSA form is that we do not only model scalar variables. All names in the program, such as fields of objects or the contents of arrays, can be represented in SSA form.

## 24.4 Other Challenging PHP Features

For simplicity, the description so far of our algorithm has only considered the problems arising from aliasing due to PHP reference variables. However, in the process of constructing SSA in our PHP compiler several other PHP language features make it difficult to identify all the points in a program where a variable may be defined. In this section, we briefly describe these language features and how they may be dealt with in order to conservatively identify all may-definitions of all variables in the program.

### 24.4.1 Runtime Symbol Tables

Figure 24.5 shows a program which accesses a variable indirectly. On line 2, a string value is read from the user and stored in the variable _var_name_. On line 3, some variable--whose name is the value in _var_name_--is set to 5. That is, any variable can be updated, and the updated variable is chosen by the user at runtime. It is not possible to know whether the user has provided the value "$x$" and so know whether $x$ has the value 5 or 6.

![image.png](https://blog-1314253005.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/202310110309268.png)

This feature is known as _variable-variables_. They are possible because a function's symbol table in PHP is available at runtime. Variables in PHP are not the same as variables in C. A C local variable is a name which represents a memory location on the stack. A PHP local variable is the domain of a map from strings to values. The same runtime value may be the domain of multiple string keys (references, discussed above). Similarly, variable-variables allow the symbol table to be accessed dynamically at runtime, allowing arbitrary values to be read and written.

Upon seeing a variable-variable, all variables may be written to. In HSSA form, this creates a $\chi$-function for every variable in the program. In order to reduce the set of variables that might be updated by assigning to a variable-variable, the contents of the string stored in _var_name_ may be modelled using a string analysis by Wasserman and Su.

String analysis is a static program analysis that models the structure of strings. For example, string analysis may be able to tell us that the name stored in the variable-variable (that is the name of the variable that will be written to) begins with the letter "x." In this case, all variables that do not begin with "x" do not require a $\chi$-function, leading to a more precise SSA form.

###  24.4.2 Execution of Arbitrary Code

PHP provides a feature that allows an arbitrary string to be executed as a code. This _eval_ statement simply executes the contents of any string as if the contents of the string appeared inline in the location of the _eval_ statement. The resulting code can modify local or global variables in arbitrary ways. The string may be computed by the program or read in from the user or from a web form.

The PHP language also allows the contents of a file to be imported into the program text using the _include_ statement. The name of the file is an arbitrary string which may be computed or read in at runtime. The result is that any file can be included in the text of the program, even one that has just been created by the program. Thus, the _include_ statement is potentially just as flexible as the _eval_ statement for arbitrarily modifying program state.

Both of these may be modelled using the same string analysis techniques as discussed in Sect. 24.4.1. The _eval_ statement may also be handled using profiling,which restricts the set of possible _eval_ statements to those which actually are used in practice.

### 24.4.3 Object Handlers

PHP's reference implementation allows classes to be partially written in C. Objects that are instantiations of these classes can have special behaviour in certain cases. For example, the objects may be dereferenced using array syntax. Or a special handler function may be called when the variable holding the object is read or written to.

The handler functions for these special cases are generally unrestricted, meaning that they can contain arbitrary C code that does anything the programmer chooses. Being written in C, they are given access to the entire program state, including all local and global variables.

These two characteristics of handlers make them very powerful but break any attempts at function-at-a-time analysis. If one of these objects is passed into a function and is read, it may overwrite all variables in the local symbol table. The overwritten variables might then have the same handlers. These can then be returned from the function or passed to any other called functions (indeed, it can also call any function). This means that a single unconstrained variable in a function can propagate to any other point in the program, and we need to treat this case conservatively.

## 24.5 Concluding Remarks and Further Reading

In this chapter, we have described our experience of building SSA in PHC, an ahead-of-time compiler for PHP. PHP is quite different to static languages such as C/C++ and Java. In addition to dynamic typing, it has other dynamic features such as very flexible and powerful reference types, variable-variables, and features that allow almost arbitrary code to be executed.

The main result of our experience is to show that SSA cannot be used as an end-to-end intermediate representation (IR) for a PHP compiler. The main reason is that in order to build SSA, significant analysis of the PHP program is needed to deal with aliasing and to rule out potential arbitrary updates of variables. We have found that in real PHP programs these features are seldom used in ways that make analysis really difficult [28]. But analysis is nonetheless necessary to show the absence of the bad use of these features.

In principle, our analysis could perform only the alias analysis prior to building SSA and perform type analysis and constant propagation in SSA. But our experience is that combining all three analyses greatly improves the precision of alias analysis.

In particular, type analysis significantly reduces the number of possible method callees in object-oriented PHP programs.

Once built, the SSA representation forms a platform for further analysis and optimization. For example, we have used it to implement an aggressive dead-code elimination pass which can eliminate both regular assignments and reference assignments.

In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the static analysis of scripting languages, with a particular focus on detecting potential security weaknesses in web-based PHP programs. For example, Jovanovic et al. [156] describe an analysis of PHP to detect vulnerabilities that allow the injection of executable code into a PHP program by a user or web form. Jensen et al. describe an alias analysis algorithm for JavaScript, which works quite differently to ours [28] but works well for JavaScript [150].

To our knowledge, we are the first to investigate building SSA in a PHP compiler. Our initial results show that building a reasonably precise SSA for PHP requires a great deal of analysis. Nonetheless, as languages such as PHP are used to build a growing number of web applications, we expect that there will be an increasing interest in tools for the static analysis of scripting languages.

## Further Reading

The HSSA algorithm is described further in Chap. 16. Array SSA form--as described in Chap. 17--was also considered for our algorithm. While we deemed HSSA a better match for the problem space, we believe we could also have adapted Array SSA for this purpose.

Our propagation algorithm is based on the Conditional Constant Propagation algorithm by Pioli and Hind [227]. It was also based on the SSA-based cousin of CCP, _Sparse_ Conditional Constant Propagation (SSA-CCP). SSA-CCP is described earlier, in Chaps. 8 and 17.

Our type-inference algorithm is based on the work by Lenart [181], which itself is based on SSA-CCP.

The variant of CCP on which we based our analysis considers alias analysis [110] alongside constant propagation. Our alias analysis was based on "points-to" analysis by Emami et al. [110]. A more detailed analysis of our alias analysis and how it interacts with constant propagation is available [28]. Previous work also looked at alias analysis in PHP, taking a simpler approach to analyse a subset of PHP [156].

Further propagation algorithms can lead to a more precise analysis. In particular, we believe string analysis, based on the work by Wassermann and Su [302], can help reduce the set of possible variables in an alias set.

This chapter is based on original research by Biggar [28], containing more discussion on our alias analysis, our form of SSA construction, and the problem of static analysis of dynamic scripting languages.

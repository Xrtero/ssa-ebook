# Chapter 18. SSA Form and Code Generation
**Benoit Dupont de Dinechin**

In a compiler for imperative languages such as C, C++, or FORTRAN, the code generator covers the set of code transformations and optimizations that are performed on a program representation close to the target machine's Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). The code generator produces an assembly source or relocatable file with debugging information.

The main duties of code generation are: lowering the program Intermediate Representation (IR) [270] to machine instruction level with appropriate calling conventions; laying out data objects in sections; composing the stack frames; allocating variable live ranges to architectural registers; scheduling instructions in order to exploit micro-architecture features; and producing assembly source or object code.

Historically, the 1986 edition of the "Compilers Principles, Techniques, and Tools" Dragon Book by Aho et al. [2] lists the tasks of code generation as

* Instruction selection and lowering of the calling conventions;
* Control-flow (dominators, loops) and data-flow (variable liveness) analyses;
* Register allocation and stack frame building;
* Peephole optimizations.

Ten years later, the 1997 textbook "Advanced Compiler Design & Implementation" by Muchnick [205] extends code generation with the following tasks:

* Loop unrolling and basic block replication
* Instruction scheduling and software pipelining
* Branch optimizations and basic block alignmentIn high-end compilers such as Open64 [64; 65], GCC [268], or LLVM [176], code generation techniques have significantly evolved, as they are mainly responsible for exploiting the performance-oriented features of architectures and micro-architectures. In those compilers, code generator optimizations include:

* If-conversion using $\text{select}$, conditional move, or predicated instructions (Chap. 20)
* Use of specialized addressing modes such as auto-modified addressing [180] and modulo addressing [66]
* Exploitation of hardware looping [183] or static branch prediction hints
* Matching fixed-point arithmetic and SIMD idioms to special instructions
* Optimization with regard to memory hierarchy, including cache prefetching and register preloading [99]
* VLIW instruction bundling, where parallel instruction groups constructed by postpass instruction scheduling are encoded into instruction bundles [159]

This sophistication of modern compiler code generation is one of the reasons behind the introduction of the SSA form for machine code, in order to simplify certain analyses and optimizations. In particular, liveness analysis (Chap. 9), if-conversion (Chap. 20), unrolling-based loop optimizations (Chap. 10), and exploitation of special instructions or addressing modes benefit significantly from the SSA form. Chapter 19 presents an advanced technique for instruction selection on the SSA form by solving a specialized quadratic assignment problem (PBQP). Although there is a debate as to whether or not SSA form should be used in a register allocator, Chap. 22 makes a convincing case for it. The challenge of correct and efficient SSA form destruction under the constraints of machine code is addressed in Chap. 21. Finally, Chap. 23 illustrates how the SSA form has been successfully applied to hardware compilation.

Basing ourselves on our experience on a family of production code generators and linear assembly optimizers for the ST120 DSP core [102, 103, 240, 275] and the Lx/ST200 VIIW family [34;-35, 100, 101, 113], this chapter reviews some of the issues of using the SSA form in a code generator. Section 18.1 presents the challenges of maintaining the SSA form on a program representation based on machine instructions. Section 18.2 discusses two code generator optimizations that seem at odds with the SSA form, yet must occur before register allocation. One is if-conversion, whose modern formulations require an extension of the SSA form. The other is prepass instruction scheduling, for which the benefit of using the SSA form has not been assessed by any implementation yet. Using the SSA form at machine-code level requires the ability to construct and destruct SSA form at that level. Section 18.3 characterizes various SSA form destruction algorithms in terms of satisfying the constraints of machine code.

## 18.1 SSA Form Engineering Issues

### 18.1.1 _Instructions, Operands, Operations, and Operators_

An _instruction_ is a member of the machine instruction set architecture (ISA). Instructions access values and modify the machine state through _operands_. We distinguish _explicit operands_, which are associated with a specific bit-field in the instruction encoding, from _implicit operands_, without any encoding bits. Explicit operands correspond to allocatable architectural registers, immediate values, or operand modifiers (such as shift, extend, saturate). Implicit operands correspond to dedicated architectural registers, and to registers implicitly used by some instructions, for instance, the status register, the procedure link register, or the stack pointer.

An _operation_ is an instance of an instruction that composes a program. It is seen by the compiler as an _operator_ applied to a list of operands (explicit and implicit), along with operand naming constraints, and has a set of clobbered registers (i.e., that can be trashed or modified in unpredictable way). The compiler view of operations also involves _indirect operands_, which are not apparent in the instruction behaviour, but are required to connect the flow of values between operations. _Implicit operands_ correspond to the registers used for passing arguments and returning results at function call sites, and may also be used for the registers encoded in register mask immediates.

### 18.1.2 Representation of Instruction Semantics

Unlike IR operators, there is no straightforward mapping between machine instructions and their semantics. For instance, a subtract instruction with operands ($a$, $b$, $c$) may either compute $c\gets a-b$ or $c\gets b-a$ or any such expression with permuted operands. Yet basic SSA form code cleanups, such as constant propagation or sign extension removal, need to know what is actually computed by machine instructions. Machine instructions may also have multiple target operands, such as memory accesses with auto-modified addressing, combined division-modulus instructions, or side-effects on status registers.

There are two ways to associate machine instructions with semantics:

* Add properties to the instruction operator and to its operands, a technique used by the Open64 compiler. Operator properties include _isAdd_, _isLoad_, etc. Typical operand properties include _isLeft_, _isRight_, _isBase_, _isOffset_, _isPredicated_, etc. Extended properties that involve the operator and some of its operands include _isAssociative_, _isCommutative_, etc.

* Associate a _semantic combinator_[300], that is, a tree of IR-like operators, to each target operand of a machine instruction. This alternative has been implemented in the SML/NJ [182] compiler and the LAO compiler [102].

An issue related to the representation of instruction semantics is how to encode it. Most information can be statically tabulated by the instruction operator, yet properties such as safety for control speculation, or equivalence to a simple IR instruction, can be refined by the context where the instruction appears. For instance, range propagation may ensure that an addition cannot overflow, that a division by zero is impossible, or that a memory access is safe for control speculation. Context-dependent semantics, which needs to be associated with specific machine instructions in the code generator's internal representation, can be provided as annotations that override the statically tabulated information.

Finally, code generation for some instruction set architectures requires that pseudo-instructions with standard semantics be available, as well as variants of $\phi$-functions and parallel copy operations.

* Machine instructions that operate on register pairs, such as the long multiplies on the ARM, or more generally on register tuples, must be handled. In such cases there is a need for pseudo-instructions to compose wide operands in register tuples, and to independently extract register allocatable operands from wide operands.
* Embedded processor architectures such as the Tensilica Xtensa [130] provide zero-overhead loops (hardware loops), where an implicit conditional branch back to the loop header is taken whenever the program counter matches some addresses. The implied loop-back branch is also conveniently materialized by a pseudo-instruction.
* Register allocation for predicated architectures requires that the live ranges of temporary variables with predicated definitions be contained by pseudo-instructions [128] that provide backward kill points for liveness analysis.

### 18.1.3 Operand Naming Constraints

Implicit operands and indirect operands are constrained to specific architectural registers, either by the instruction set architecture (ISA constraints) or by the application binary interface (ABI constraints). An effective way to deal with such _dedicated register_ naming constraints in the SSA form is to insert parallel copy operations that write to the constrained source operands, or read from the constrained target operands of instructions. The new SSA variables thus created are pre-coloured with the required architectural register. With modern SSA form destruction [35; 267] (see Chap. 21), copy operations are aggressively coalesced, and the remaining ones are sequentialized into machine operations.

Explicit instruction operands may be constrained to use the same resource (an unspecified architectural register) between a source and a target operand,as illustrated by most x86 instructions [257] and by DSP-style auto-modified addressing modes [180]. A related naming constraint is to require different resources between source and destination operands, as with the mul instructions on the ARMv5 processors. The _same resource_ naming constraints are represented under the SSA form by inserting a copy operation between the constrained source operand and a new variable, then using this new variable as the constrained source operand. In case of multiple constrained source operands, a parallel copy operation is used. Again, these copy operations are processed by the SSA form destruction.

A more widespread case of an operand naming constraint is when a variable must be bound to a specific architectural register at all points in the program. This is the case with the stack pointer, as interrupt handling may reuse the runtime stack at any program point. One possibility is to inhibit the promotion of the stack pointer to a SSA variable. Stack pointer definitions, including memory allocations through alloca(), activation frame creation/destruction, are then encapsulated as instances of a specific pseudo-instruction. Instructions that use the stack pointer must be treated as special cases for SSA form analyses and optimizations.

### 18.1.4 Non-kill Target Operands

The SSA form requires variable definitions to be killing definitions (see e.g. [208] or kill points in data-flow analysis). This is not the case for target operands such as a status register, which contains several independent bit-fields. Moreover, some instruction effects on bit-fields may be _sticky_, that is, with an implied disjunction with the previous value. Typical sticky bits include exception flags of the IEEE 754 arithmetic, or the integer overflow flag on DSPs with fixed-point arithmetic. When mapping a status register to a SSA variable, any operation that partially reads or modifies the register bit-fields should appear as reading and writing the corresponding variable.

Predicated execution and conditional execution are other sources of definitions that do not kill their target register. The execution of predicated instructions is guarded by the evaluation of a single bit operand. The execution of conditional instructions is guarded by the evaluation of a condition on a multi-bit operand. We extend the ISA classification of [193] to include four classes:

**Partial predicated execution support**: select instructions, first introduced by the Multiflow TRACE architecture [81], are provided. These instructions write to a destination register the value of one among two source operands, depending on the condition tested on a third source operand. The Multiflow TRACE 500 architecture was planned to include predicated store and floating-point instructions [189].
**Full predicated execution support**: Most instructions accept a boolean predicate operand, which nullifies the instruction effects if the predicate evaluates to false. EPIC-style architectures also provide predicate define instructions(pdi) to efficiently evaluate predicates corresponding to nested conditions: Unconditional, Conditional, parallel or, parallel and[128].
**Partial conditional execution support**: Conditional move (cmcov) instructions, first introduced by the Alpha AXP architecture [31], are provided. cmov instructions have been available in the ia32 ISA since the Pentium Pro.
**Full conditional execution support**: Most instructions are conditionally executed depending on the evaluation of a condition of a source operand. On the ARM architecture, the implicit source operand is a bit-field in the status register and the condition is encoded on 4 bits. On the VelociTIT(tm) TMS230C6x architecture [256], the source operand is a general register encoded on 3 bits and the condition is encoded on 1 bit.

### 18.1.5 Program Representation Invariants

Engineering a code generator requires decisions about which information is transient and which belongs to the invariants of the program representation. An _invariant_ is a property that is ensured before and after each phase. Transient information is recomputed as needed by some phases from the program representation invariants. The applicability of the SSA form only spans the early phases of the code generation process: from instruction selection down to register allocation. After register allocation, program variables are mapped to architectural registers or to memory locations, so the SSA form analyses and optimizations no longer apply. In addition, a program may be only partially converted to the SSA form. This is the reason for the engineering of the SSA form as extensions to a baseline code generator program representation.

Some extensions to the program representation required by the SSA form are better engineered as invariants, in particular for operands, operations, basic blocks, and control-flow graphs. Operands that are SSA variables need to record the unique operation that defines them as a target operand, and possibly to maintain the list of the places where they appear as source operands. Operations such as $\phi$-functions, $\sigma$-functions of the SSI form [36] (see Chap. 13), and parallel copies may appear as regular operations constrained to specific places in the basic blocks. The incoming (resp. outgoing) edges of basic blocks also need be kept in the same order as the operands of each of their $\phi$-functions (resp. $\sigma$-functions).

A program representation invariant that impacts the engineering of SSA form is the structure of loops. The modern way of identifying loops in a CFG is the construction of a loop nesting forest as defined by Ramalingam[236]. High-level information such as loop-carried memory dependencies, or user-level loop annotations, should be provided to the code generator. Such information is attached to a loop structure, which thus becomes an invariant. The impact on the SSA form is that some loop nesting forests, such as the Havlak[142] loop structure, are more suitable than others as they can be used to attach to basic blocks the results of key analyses such as SSA variable liveness [36] (see Chap. 9).

Live-in and live-out sets at basic block boundaries are also candidates for program representation invariants. However, when using and updating liveness information under the SSA form, it appears convenient to distinguish the $\phi$-function contributions from the results of data-flow fixed-point computation. In particular, Sreedhar et al. [267] introduced the $\phi$-function semantics that became later known as _multiplexing mode_ (see Chap. 21), where a $\phi$-function $B_{0}:a_{0}=\phi\,(B_{1}:a_{1},\,\ldots,\,B_{n}:a_{n})$ makes $a_{0}$ live-in of basic block $B_{0}$, and $a_{1},\,\ldots\,a_{n}$ live-out of basic blocks $B_{1},\,\ldots\,B_{n}$. The classical basic block invariants $\text{LiveIn}(B)$ and $\text{LiveOut}(B)$ are then complemented with $\text{PhiDes}(B)$ and $\text{PhiUses}(B)$.

Finally, some compilers adopt the invariant that the SSA form be _conventional_ across the code generation phases. This approach is motivated by the fact that classical optimizations such as SSAPRE [164] (see Chap. 11) require that "the live ranges of different versions of the same original program variable do not overlap," implying that the SSA form should be conventional. Other compilers that use SSA numbers and omit the $\phi$-functions from the program representation [175] are similarly constrained. Work by Sreedhar et al. [267] and by Boissinot et al. [35] have clarified how to convert the transformed SSA form into conventional form wherever required, so there now is no reason for this property to be an invariant.

## 18.2 Code Generation Phases and the SSA Form

### 18.2.1 If-Conversion

If-conversion refers to optimizations that convert a program region to straight-line code. It is primarily motivated by instruction scheduling on instruction-level parallel cores [193], as removing conditional branches serves to:

* Eliminate branch resolution stalls in the instruction pipeline
* Reduce uses of the branch unit, which is often single-issue
* Increase the size of the instruction scheduling regions

In case of inner loop bodies, if-conversion further enables vectorization [5] and software pipelining [220] (modulo scheduling). Consequently, control-flow regions selected for if-conversion are acyclic, even though seminal techniques [5, 220] consider more general control-flow.

The scope and effectiveness of if-conversion depend on the ISA support. In principle, any if-conversion technique targeted to full predicated or conditional execution support may be adapted to partial predicated or conditional execution support. For instance, non-predicated instructions with side-effects such as memory accesses can be used in combination with select to provide a harmless effective address in the event that the operation must be nullified [193].

Besides predicated or conditional execution, architectural support for if-conversion is improved by supporting speculative execution. Speculative execution (control speculation) refers to executing an operation before knowing that its execution is required, which happens when moving code above a branch [189] or promoting operation predicates [193]. Speculative execution assumes that instructions have reversible side effects, so speculating potentially excepting instructions requires architectural support. On the Multiflow TRACE 300 architecture and later on the Lx VLIW architecture [113], non-trapping memory loads known as _dismissible_ loads are provided. The IMPACT EPIC architecture speculative execution [13] is generalized from the _sentinel_ model [192].

#### **Classical Contributions to If-Conversion Without SSA Form**

The initial classical contributions to if-conversion did not consider the SSA form. The goal of this paragraph is to provide a short overview of those contributions.

_Allen et al._ [5]Conversion of control dependencies to data dependencies, motivated by inner loop vectorization. The authors distinguish forward branches, exit branches, and backward branches and compute boolean guards accordingly. As this work pre-dates the Program Dependence Graph [118] (see Chap. 14), the complexity of the resulting boolean expressions is an issue. When compared to later if-conversion techniques, only the conversion of forward branches is relevant.

_Park and Schlansker_ [220]Formulation of the "_RK algorithm_" based on control dependencies. The authors assume a fully predicated architecture with only conditional pdi instructions. The $R$ function assigns a minimal set of boolean predicates to basic blocks, and the $K$ function expresses the way those predicates are computed (Fig. 18.1). The algorithm is general enough to process cyclic and irreducible rooted flow graphs, but in practice it is applied to single-entry acyclic regions.

_Blickstein et al._ [31]Pioneering use of cmov instructions to replace conditional branches in the GEM compilers for the Alpha AXP architecture.

_Lowney et al._ [189]Matching of the innermost if-then constructs in the Multiflow Trace Scheduling compiler, in order to generate the select and the predicated memory store operations.

_Fang_ [112]The proposed algorithm assumes a fully predicated architecture with conditional pdi instructions. It is tailored to acyclic regions with single entry and multiple exits, and as such is able to compute both $R$ and $K$ functions without relying on explicit control dependencies. The main improvement of this algorithm over [220] is that it also speculates instructions up the dominance tree through _predicate promotion_,1 except for stores and pdi instructions. This work further proposes a pre-optimization pass performed before predication and speculation that hoist or sink common sub-expressions.

Footnote 1: The predicate used to guard an operation is promoted to a weaker condition.

_Leupers_ [184]The technique focuses on if-conversion of nested if-then-else statements for architectures with full conditional execution support. A dynamic programming technique appropriately selects either a conditional jump or a conditional instruction-based implementation scheme for each if-then-else statement. The objective is the reduction of worst-case execution time (WCET).

#### **Classical Contributions to If-Conversion with Internal Use of SSA Form**

We now describe two contributions to if-conversion that did use the SSA form, but only internally.

_Jacome et al._ [148]Proposition of the Static Single Assignment--Predicated Switching (SSA-PS) transformation. This assumes a clustered VIW architecture fitted with conditional move instructions that operate inside clusters (internal moves) or between clusters (external moves). The first idea of the SSA-PS transformation is to perform the conditional assignments corresponding to $\phi$-functions via predicated switching operations, in particular conditional move operations. The second idea is that the conditional external moves leverage the penalties associated with inter-cluster data transfers. The SSA-PS transformation predicates non-move operations and is apparently restricted to innermost if-then-else statements.

_Chuang et al._ [74]A predicated execution support aimed at removing non-kill register writes from the micro-architecture. They propose select instructions called _PHI-ops_ (similar to the $\phi_{\mathit{if}}$-function described in Sect. 14.4), predicated memory accesses, unconditional pdi instructions, and orp instructions for or-ing multiple predicates. The RK algorithm is simplified for the case of single-entry single-exit regions, and adapted to the proposed architectural support. The other contribution is the generation of PHI-ops, whose insertion points are computed like the SSA form placement of $\phi$-functions. The $\phi$-functions' source operands are replaced by _phi-lists_, where each operand is associated with the predicate of its source basic block. The phi-lists are processed by topological order of the predicates to generate the PHI-ops.

#### If-Conversion Under SSA Form

The ability to perform if-conversion on the SSA form of a program representation requires the handling of operations that do not kill the target operand because of predicated or conditional execution. The following papers address this issue:

_Stoutchinin and Ferrière_ [275]  Introduction of $\psi$-functions in order to represent fully predicated code under the SSA form, which is then called the $\psi$-SSA form. The $\psi$-functions' arguments are paired with predicates and are ordered in dominance order in the $\psi$-function argument list. This ordering is a correctness condition re-discovered by Chuang et al.[74] for their PHI-ops. The $\psi$-SSA form is presented in Chap.15 .

_Stoutchinin and Gao_[276] Proposition of an if-conversion technique based on the predication of Fang [112] _and the replacement of $\phi$-functions by $\psi$-functions. The authors prove that the conversion is correct provided that the SSA form is conventional. The technique is implemented in Open64 for the IA-64 architecture.

_Bruel_[52] The technique targets VIW architectures with select and dismissible load instructions. The proposed framework reduces acyclic control-flow constructs from innermost to outermost. A benefit criterion is used to stop the reduction process. The core technique performs control speculation in addition to tail duplication, and reduces the height of predicate computations. It can also generate $\psi$-functions instead of select operations. A generalization of this framework, which also accepts $\psi$-SSA form as input, is described in Chap.20

_Ferriere_[104]Extension of the $\psi$_-SSA form algorithms of_ [275] _to architectures with partial predicated execution support, by formulating simple correctness conditions for the predicate promotion of operations that do not have side-effects. This work also details how to transform the_ $\psi$_-SSA form to conventional_ $\psi$_-SSA form by generating cmov operations. A self-contained explanation of these techniques appears in Chap._ 15.

Thanks to these contributions, virtually all if-conversion techniques formulated without the SSA form can be adapted to the $\psi$_-SSA form, with the added benefit that already predicated code may be part of the input. In practice, these contributions follow the generic steps of if-conversion proposed by Fang_ [112]:

* _If-conversion region selection_
* _Code hoisting and sinking of common sub-expressions_
* _Assignment of predicates to the basic blocks_* Insertion of operations to compute the basic block predicates
* Predication or speculation of operations
* Conditional branch removal

The result of an if-converted region is a hyper-block, that is, a sequence of basic blocks with predicated or conditional operations, where control may only enter from the top, but may exit from one or more locations [191].

Although if-conversion based on the $\psi$-SSA form appears effective for the different classes of architectural support, the downstream phases of the code generator require some adaptations of the plain SSA form algorithms to handle the $\psi$-functions. The largest impact of handling $\psi$-functions is apparent in the $\psi$-SSA form destruction [104], whose original description [275] was incomplete.

In order to avoid such complexities, a code generator may adopt a simpler solution than the $\psi$-functions to represent the non-kill effects of conditional operations on target operands. The key observation is that under the SSA form, a cmov operation is equivalent to a select operation with the _same resource_ naming constraint between one source and the target operand. Unlike other predicated or conditional instructions, a select instruction kills its target register. Generalizing this observation provides a simple way to handle predicated or conditional operations in plain SSA form:

* For each target operand of the predicated or conditional instruction, add a corresponding source operand in the instruction signature.
* For each added source operand, add the same resource naming constraint with the corresponding target operand.

This simple transformation enables the SSA form analyses and optimizations to remain oblivious to predicated or conditional execution. The drawback of this solution is that non-kill definitions of a given variable (before SSA variable renaming) remain in dominance order across program transformations, as opposed to $\psi$-SSA where predicate value analysis may enable this order to be relaxed.

### 18.2.2 Prepass Instruction Scheduling

Further down the code generator, the last major phase before register allocation is prepass instruction scheduling. Innermost loops with a single basic block, super-block, or hyper-block body are candidates for software pipelining techniques such as modulo scheduling [241]. For innermost loops that are not software pipelined, and for other program regions, acyclic instruction scheduling techniques apply: basic block scheduling [131]; super-block scheduling [146]; hyper-block scheduling [191]; tree region scheduling [140]; or trace scheduling [189].

By definition, prepass instruction scheduling operates before register allocation. At this stage, instruction operands are mostly virtual registers, except for instructions with ISA or ABI constraints that bind them to specific architectural registers.

Moreover, preparation for prepass instruction scheduling includes virtual register renaming, also known as register web construction, whose goal is to reduce the number of anti-dependencies and output dependencies in the instruction scheduling problem. Such code preconditioning would not be required under SSA form, but the design of an SSA based prepass instruction scheduling algorithm would face several difficulties including:

* Ordering constraints related to control dependencies and true data dependencies have to be fulfiled so as to avoid violating the semantic of the original code. Anti-dependencies, on the other hand, are artifacts of the storage allocation. Temporary variable renaming (with the most aggressive form being obtained by SSA construction) removes such dependencies, thus giving more freedom to the scheduling heuristic. The more freedom, the more potential effect on interferences between variables, and thus on register pressure. Without adding any bias on the scheduling strategy to account for register pressure and renaming constraints, important negative impacts might be observed with the insertion of shuffle code such as spill and register-to-register copies.
* Some machine instructions have partial effects on special resources such as the status register. Representing special resources as SSA variables even though they are accessed at the bit-field level requires coarsening the instruction effects to the whole resource, as discussed in Sect. 18.1.4. Doing so naively would lead to the creation of spurious data-flow dependencies associated with the def-use chain of the special resource. Moreover, def-use ordering implied by SSA form is not adapted to resources composed of sticky bits, as the definitions of these resources can be reordered. Scheduling OR-type predicate define operations [255] raises the same issues. An instruction scheduler is also expected to precisely track accesses to unrelated or partially overlapping bit-fields in a status register. More generally, some sets of operations might be considered as commutative in the IR. A reordering with relaxed constraints may, under SSA, create inconsistencies (that have to be fixed) among the implicit def-use relationships between impacted instructions.

To summarize, trying to keep the SSA form inside the prepass instruction scheduling seems reasonable but requires non-trivial adaptations.

## 18.3 SSA Form Destruction Algorithms

The destruction of the SSA form in a code generator is required at some point. A weaker form of SSA destruction is the conversion of transformed SSA form to conventional SSA form, which is required by a few classical SSA form optimizations such as SSAPRE (see Chap. 11). For all such cases, the main objective is the lowering to machine-code representation (getting rid of pseudo-instructions and satisfying naming constraints) by inserting the necessary copy/spill instructions.

The contributions to SSA form destruction techniques can be characterized as an evolution towards correctness, the ability to manage operand naming constraints, the handling of critical edges, and the reduction of algorithmic time and memory requirements. One of the main contributions is also the coupling with register allocation and the generation of high-quality code in terms of edge splitting and the amount of inserted copies.

**_Cytron et al_.** [90] First technique for _translating out of SSA_, by "naive replacement preceded by dead code elimination and followed by colouring." The authors replace each $\phi$-function $B_{0}:a_{0}=\phi(B_{1}:a_{1},\ldots,$$B_{n}:a_{n})$ by $n$ copies $a_{0}=a_{l}$, one per basic block $B_{i}$, before applying Chaitin-style coalescing. 

_**Briggs et al.**_ [50] The correctness issues of Cytron et al. [90] out of (transformed) SSA form translation are identified and illustrated by the _lost-copy problem_ and the _swap problem_. These problems appear in relation to the critical edges and when the parallel assignment semantics of a sequence of $\phi$-functions at the start of a basic block is not accounted for [35]. Two SSA form destruction algorithms are proposed, depending on the presence of critical edges in the control-flow graph. However, the need for parallel copy operations to represent code after $\phi$-function removal is not recognized. 

**_Sreedhar et al._** [267] This work is based on the definition of $\phi$-congruence classes as the sets of SSA variables that are transitively connected by a $\phi$-function. When none of the $\phi$-congruence classes has members that interfere, the SSA form is called _conventional_ and its destruction is trivial: replace all the SSA variables of a $\phi$-congruence class by a temporary variable, and remove the $\phi$-functions. In general, the SSA form is _transformed_ after program optimizations, that is, some $\phi$-congruence classes contain interferences. In Method I, the SSA form is made conventional by isolating $\phi$-functions using copies both at the end of direct predecessor blocks and at the start of the current block. The latter is the key for not depending on critical edge splitting [35]. The code is then improved by running a new SSA variable coalescer that grows the $\phi$-congruence classes with copy-related variables, while keeping the SSA form conventional. In Method II and Method III, the $\phi$-congruence classes are initialized as singletons, then merged as the $\phi$-functions are processed. In Method II, two variables of the current $\phi$-function that interfere directly or through their $\phi$-congruence classes are isolated by inserting copy operations for both. This ensures that the $\phi$-congruence class that is grown from the classes of the variables related by the current $\phi$-function is interference-free. In Method III, if possible only one copy operation is inserted to remove the interference, and more involved choices about which variables to isolate from the $\phi$-function congruence class are resolved by a maximum independent set heuristic. Both methods are correct except for a detail about the live-out sets to consider when testing for interferences [35]. 

**_Leung and George_** [182] This work is the first to address the problem of satisfying the _same resource_ and the _dedicated register_ operand naming constraints of the SSA form on machine code. They identify that Chaitin-style coalescing after SSA form destruction is not sufficient, and that adapting the SSA optimizations to enforce operand naming constraints is not practical. They work in three steps: collect the renaming constraints; mark the renaming conflicts; and reconstruct code, which adapts the SSA destruction of Briggs et al. [50]. This work is also the first to make explicit use of parallel copy operations. A few correctness issues were later identified and corrected by Rastello et al. [240].

**Budimlic et al.** [53]_ Contribution of a lightweight SSA form destruction motivated by JIT compilation. It uses the (strict) SSA form property of dominance of variable definitions over uses to avoid the maintenance of an explicit interference graph. Unlike previous approaches to SSA form destruction that coalesce increasingly larger sets of non-interfering $\phi$-related (and copy-related) variables, they first construct SSA webs with early pruning of obviously interfering variables, then de-coalesce the SSA webs into non-interfering classes. They propose the _dominance forest_ explicit data structure to speed up these interference tests. This SSA form destruction technique does not handle the operand naming constraints, and also requires critical edge splitting.

**_Rastello et al.** [240]_ The problem of satisfying the _same resource_ and _dedicated register_ operand naming constraints of the SSA form on machine code is revisited, motivated by erroneous code produced by the technique of Leung and George [182]. Inspired by the work of Sreedhar et al. [267], they include the $\phi$-related variables as candidates in the coalescing that optimizes the operand naming constraints. This work avoids the patent of Sreedhar et al. (US patent 6182284).

**_Boissinot et al.** [35]_ Formulation of a generic approach to SSA form destruction that is proved correct handles operand naming constraints and can be optimized for speed (see Chap. 21 for details of this generic approach). The foundation of this approach is to transform the program to conventional SSA form by isolating the $\phi$-functions like in Method I of Sreedhar et al. [267]. However, the copy operations inserted are parallel, so a parallel copy sequentialization algorithm is provided. The task of improving the conventional SSA form is then seen as a classical aggressive variable coalescing problem, but thanks to the SSA form the interference relation between SSA variables is made precise and frugal to compute. Interference is obtained by combining the intersection of SSA live ranges, and the equality of values, which is easily tracked under the SSA form across copy operations. Moreover, the use of the dominance forest data structure of Budimlic et al. [53] to speed up interference tests between congruence classes is obviated by a linear traversal of these classes in pre-order of the dominance tree. Finally, the same resource operand constraints are managed by pre-coalescing, and the dedicated register operand constraints are represented by pre-colouring the congruence classes. Congruence classes with a different pre-colouring always interfere.
